Hereâ€™s a draft for your `README.md` file for the project hosted at the GitHub repository [Assembler-C](https://github.com/Shay-Gabison/Assembler-C.git):

# Assembler-C

Assembler-C is a project that implements a basic assembler for a simple assembly language. The assembler translates assembly code into machine code, which can then be executed by a simulated processor.

## Features

- **Assembly Code Parsing:** Parses assembly language instructions and operands.
- **Machine Code Generation:** Converts parsed assembly instructions into machine code.
- **Error Handling:** Detects and reports syntax errors and other issues in assembly code.
- **Output Files:** Generates object files that contain the machine code.

## Installation

To use Assembler-C, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use any standard C compiler like `gcc`.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shay-Gabison/Assembler-C.git
cd Assembler-C
```

### Build the Project

```bash
make
```

This command will compile the source code and generate the executable.

## Usage

To assemble a file, run the following command:

```bash
./assembler input.asm output.o
```

- `input.asm` is the assembly source file you want to assemble.
- `output.o` is the output object file that will be generated.

## File Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code files for the assembler.
- `include/`: Contains header files.
- `test/`: Contains test assembly files and scripts.
- `Makefile`: The Makefile for building the project.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Example

Here is an example of an assembly file `example.asm`:

```assembly
MOV R1, #5
ADD R1, R2
```

After assembling with:

```bash
./assembler example.asm example.o
```

The `example.o` file will be generated, containing the corresponding machine code.
